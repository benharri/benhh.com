### Several systems I considered for my website:
+ [Django](https://djangoproject.com/)
    * Django's opinionated Model model with its strong database ties seemed a bit much for a relatively static site
    * It would be a great learning experience in Python
+ [Vanilla PHP](https://php.net)
    * I have a lot of experience in vanilla PHP at my internship at [Northern Michigan University](http://nmu.edu) working in the Information Services department where I develop web applications for internal use.
    * I often find myself frustrated with PHP's quirkiness and wouldn't learn new material.
+ [Silex](https://silex.sensiolabs.com)
    * This is a new micro-framework built using bare components of the much larger [Symfony](https://symfony.com) framework.
    * I discovered Silex in [Heroku's PHP deployment guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php) where I noticed that it was small enough to not draw unneeded overhead and extensible enough for my website to grow as it needed.
    * This is the framework that I eventually decided to use for my site.
