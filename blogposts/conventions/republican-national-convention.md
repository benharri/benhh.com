I was asked to chaperone a group of youth journalists with 8-18 Media (a youth journalism program in Marquette that I was once a part of)

__Disclaimer:__ these blog posts represent my opinion!

I plan on writing a post for each day of the RNC journaling my thoughts about the event.
+ [__Day One__](/blog/conventions/rnc-day-one) - Benghazi and weaponization of grief
+ [__Day Two__](/blog/conventions/rnc-day-two) - Make America Work Again (It's already working with a very low unemployment rate)
+ [__Day Three__](/blog/conventions/rnc-day-three) - Make America First Again featuring the second and third place candidates from the Republican primary
+ [__Day Four__](/blog/conventions/rnc-day-four) - Make America One Again
