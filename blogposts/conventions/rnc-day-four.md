__UPDATE__ looks like an article of convention notes by two of our reporters ran in the [Mining Journal](http://www.miningjournal.net/page/content.detail/id/643873/Notes-from-the-convention-hall.html?nav=5192)! 

### This is a collection of some of my thoughts from watching various speakers at the conventions. No editing here...

guy shouts under __GOD__ during the pledge of allegiance

pledge of allegiance is creepy enough already

military spending (smallest military)??/ fact check

move the party back to the right? 

Bring in the evangelicals that we lost

Abide by radical right platform *applause, standing ovation*

Kill all the _terrorists_.

thanks, god

salvation only for our friends and no one who is different from us

mike pence amazing- nope, devil incarnate

repubs want smaller govt but want to regulate personal freedoms. wut.

white privilege
