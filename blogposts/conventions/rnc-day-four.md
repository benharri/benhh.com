__UPDATE__ looks like an article of convention notes by two of our reporters ran in the [Mining Journal](http://www.miningjournal.net/page/content.detail/id/643873/Notes-from-the-convention-hall.html?nav=5192)! 

Trump is officially the Republican nominee for President of the United States of America. My first reaction to this news was a feeling of impending doom.
