# Republican National Convention in Cleveland - Day One

> Disclaimer: The following article represents my opinions and should be interpreted as such.

Michigan delegates to the Republican National Convention got fired up for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie as he addressed them this morning at their first breakfast meeting. Christie stressed the importance of party unity behind the presumptive nominee, Donald Trump. 

However, the enthusiasm for Trump was not as strong as expected. The emphasis was placed on bashing Hillary, rather than promoting a Trump presidency. It makes sense, as it's very hard to promote a candidate who has nothing to offer.

The scene downtown has also been more peaceful than expected.

Any mention of Hillary Clinton's name

"goodness of his heart"
"a man who knows how to get things done"
"a man who says what he means and means what he says"
"Make America America again"
